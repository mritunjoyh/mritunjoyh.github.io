I am an AI Researcher at <a href='https://www.tcs.com/what-we-do/research'>TCS Research</a>, working in Generative AI and 3D Computer Vision. Previously, I completed my Bachelor's at <a href='https://www.iiests.ac.in/'>IIEST Shibpur</a>.

My current research at TCS Research (formerly known as TRDDC), focuses on building immersive 3D worlds for AR/VR environments, where users experience an artificial reality that evolves based on their thoughts. My work spans computer vision, computer graphics, robotics, image processing, and machine learning.

My work has been recognized in several peer-reviewed journals and conferences, including IEEE IJCNN and Multimedia Tools and Applications (Springer).
